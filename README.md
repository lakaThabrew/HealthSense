# HealthSense - AI Health Assistant

HealthSense is a next-generation, multimodal health companion designed to provide immediate, safety-focused symptom analysis. Powered by **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model, it combines advanced computer vision with medical reasoning to help users understand visible health concerns.

**⚠️ Disclaimer:** HealthSense is an AI tool, not a medical device. It does not provide medical diagnoses. Always consult a licensed healthcare professional for medical concerns.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Advanced AI Analysis
*   **Multimodal Reasoning:** Analyzes images, text descriptions, and voice input simultaneously to provide comprehensive assessments.
*   **Smart Risk Assessment:** Automatically categorizes symptoms into **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** risk levels with structured home care advice.
*   **Context-Aware Modes:** tailored AI personas for specific user needs:
    *   **Common:** Standard adult health advice.
    *   **Child:** Pediatric focus (gentler, behavior-oriented).
    *   **Pregnancy:** Obstetric focus (maternal/fetal safety).
    *   **Elderly:** Geriatric focus (medication interactions, skin fragility).

### 👁️ Futuristic UI/UX
*   **Biometric Camera HUD:** Real-time symptom scanner with a tactical dot-matrix grid, locking reticles, and simulated data readouts (`SEARCHING` -> `LOCKING` -> `DETECTED` phases).
*   **Interactive AI Orb:** An immersive voice interface that visualizes listening, thinking, and speaking states with fluid animations.

### 🗣️ Seamless Voice Interaction
*   **Hands-Free Conversation:** A continuous loop system (Speak -> AI Responds -> Listen) allows for natural dialogue without repeated clicking.
*   **Neural Text-to-Speech:** High-quality, natural-sounding voice responses generated by the `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts` model.

### 🛡️ Reliability & Safety
*   **Robust Error Handling:** Smart retry mechanisms with exponential backoff and automatic fallbacks (e.g., if Google Maps fails, the AI seamlessly switches to text-only advice).
*   **Permission Guidance:** Custom interfaces to guide users through unblocking camera/microphone access if denied by the browser.
*   **Privacy First:** All chat history and user profiles are stored locally in the browser (`localStorage`). No data is sent to external servers other than the AI model.

### 📍 Location & Tools
*   **Grounding:** Finds nearby **Hospitals** and **Pharmacies** using Google Maps integration.
*   **PDF Export:** Generates professional health reports suitable for sharing with doctors.
*   **System Diagnostics:** Built-in self-check tool to verify API connectivity, media permissions, and storage health.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (with Dark Mode support)
*   **AI Model:** Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash`) via `@google/genai` SDK
*   **Voice:** Web Speech API (Input) & Gemini TTS (Output)
*   **PDF Generation:** jsPDF
